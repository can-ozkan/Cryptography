Security comes from both a strong algorithm - one that cannot be reversed without the key and a key that cannot be found or guessed
Keys : a sequence of random bits, the range of allowable values is called a keyspace
The larger the key space, the more secure the key will be

Symmetric Cryptography
----------------------
One key encrypts and decrypts data
Cleartext with key makes ciphertext
Ciphertext with key makes cleartext
Symmetric algorithms are fast
Difficult to break if a large key size is used
Only one key is needed
